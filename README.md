ABOUT Ai Bot
An AI bot is a computer program that is designed to simulate human conversation and behavior. It can be used to automate customer service, provide personalized recommendations, and even help with decision-making. AI bots are becoming increasingly popular as they can provide a more efficient and cost-effective way of providing customer service.

AI bots use natural language processing (NLP) to understand the user’s input and respond accordingly. They can also use machine learning algorithms to learn from past conversations and become more accurate over time. AI bots are able to provide personalized responses based on the user’s preferences, which makes them more effective than traditional customer service methods.

AI bots can also be used for decision-making tasks such as analyzing data or making predictions about future trends. This allows businesses to make better decisions faster and with less effort. AI bots can also be used for marketing purposes, such as providing personalized recommendations or helping customers find the best deals on products or services.

Overall, AI bots are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to automate customer service tasks, provide personalized recommendations, and help with decision-making tasks. They are cost-effective and efficient solutions that can help businesses save time and money while providing better customer service experiences.

HOW TO DO THIS??
1. Create a new repository on GitHub and clone it to your local machine.

2. Install the necessary dependencies for the chatbot, such as TensorFlow, Keras, and NLTK.

3. Download the dataset for training the chatbot.

4. Pre-process the data to make it suitable for training the model.

5. Build a model using TensorFlow and Keras that can generate responses based on user input.

6. Train the model using the dataset and evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy and F1 score.

7. Deploy the model to a web server or cloud platform such as Heroku or AWS Lambda so that it can be accessed by users from anywhere in the world.
